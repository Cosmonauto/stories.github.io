    <h1>Sirki</h1>
    <div>
        I heard there is a sale on sirki(russian sweets) in Dicksi(Walmart of Russia) today. I dress up. I leave. I stand there
        in front of the shelf deciding on which type of sirok I want, so that my budget wouldn’t fade away, I need money. I pick
        three of the cheapest ones. I notice a Dicksi woman crouching next to me while stacking up the shelves. Only problem is,
        what is she stacking up if she isn’t holding anything. She starts peeing. I’m standing in the puddle. I need rice. I’m
        at the cash register. I put all of my groceries on the conveyer belt. Cashier, a middle aged woman. I look into her
        eyes, I see pain, 12 years of school, an electrical engineering degree from a promising university, getting pregnant by
        accident, an abusive drinking husband, a marriage on the brink of collapse and overdue loans. I ask how much. She
        kindly whispers - "churka". The sunsets in this city are so beautiful you almost want to cry.
